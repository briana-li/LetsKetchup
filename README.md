# FoodGroup App: LetsKetchup
Final Project for Brandeis University's Mobile App Development Class:

**App Name:** LetsKetchup  
**Team Members:** Jordan Prudhomme, Steven Chen, Ritika Saxena, Briana Li, Jonas Tjahjadi 

*App designed on Android Studio*

Compatible Versions Minimum SDK: Marshmallow (Android 6.0) and up

## Purpose
Allow people of any demographic to communicate and catch up with each other! We intend for people to schedule a time and place to grab a meal,
especially since that can get really disorganized with groups of people. Registered accounts are put on the Firebase.

## Usage 

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Go to *File --> New --> Project from Version Control --> Git*
3. Copy and paste the URL for the repo, and name your project in your AndroidStudioProjects directory
4. (Possible) If you get an error, click *Install Build Tools or install a new version of the gradle*. You may have to rebuild the project.
5. If you are a contributor, then you should be able to pull, commit, push etc.

## Implemented Features

* Splash Screen Activity
* Login Activity
* Menu that contains: Setting, About, Friends, Profile, Sign Out
* Implementation of the **Firebase API** (very useful, credits to other git documentation TBD)
